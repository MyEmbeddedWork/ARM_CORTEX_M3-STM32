.IP "1." 4
This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from user application:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBSystemInit()\fP: Setups the system clock (System clock source, PLL Multiplier factors, AHB/APBx prescalers and Flash settings)\&. This function is called at startup just after reset and before branch to main program\&. This call is made inside the 'startup_stm32f10x_xx\&.s' file\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure other parameters\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBSystemCoreClockUpdate()\fP: Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must be called whenever the core clock is changed during program execution\&.
.PP

.IP "2." 4
After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source\&. Then \fBSystemInit()\fP function is called, in 'startup_stm32f10x_xx\&.s' file, to configure the system clock before to branch to main program\&.
.IP "3." 4
If the system clock source selected by user fails to startup, the \fBSystemInit()\fP function will do nothing and HSI still used as system clock source\&. User can add some code to deal with this issue inside the SetSysClock() function\&.
.IP "4." 4
The default value of HSE crystal is set to 8 MHz (or 25 MHz, depedning on the product used), refer to 'HSE_VALUE' define in 'stm32f10x\&.h' file\&. When HSE is used as system clock source, directly or through PLL, and you are using different crystal you have to adapt the HSE value to your own configuration\&.
